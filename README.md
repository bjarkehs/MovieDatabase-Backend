# MovieDatabase-Backend

This repo was originally used for a course in iOS development.

It is not currently the plan to add a lot of functionality. But it will be extended to have a few more APIs.
It would also be great to have some sort of access to a movie database.

It can be run with `npm start` or you can build the docker image and run that.
